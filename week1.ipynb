In this context, misinterpretation of data is growing by leaps and bounds. Therefore, mastering data literacy is essential: This requires the ability to not only carry out statistical analysis on real world problems, but also to understand and critique any conclusion drawn by others on the basis of statistics.\n",

    "Imagine your former headteacher suddenly approaching you on WeChat: \"Hey, you are a polytechnic student right? Could you help me analyse our school's student pool this year?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "While in reality your class teacher probably wouldn't ask such a unreasonable request of you, and your alma mater would have a dedicated data analyst (probably), if you were actually asked this question, your first reaction would probably be - **\"How can I do it since you haven't mentioned any details? \"**\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, this is the situation you are most likely to find yourself in when faced with social reality. There are no definite requirements, just a living, breathing world out there. What to do?\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to dismantle the problem. Now, since we need to use data to study social problems, we should work around the problem and the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have a problem, the first step we have to take is **data collection**. The process of data collection is painful, so don't expect us to take care of it for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "After sending out various questionnaires (and red packets) in various large groups, Qzone, friends and other places, and going through various websites with publicly available data, you finally have a big pile of raw data. Then the second step is **data cleaning**. In order to organise the data into something you can use and get rid of the invalid content in the data, you will probably need a few methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you have structured data. It's time to face our problem head on - you need to turn this data into an estimated quantity by **data analysis**. The estimator actually infers to a function of a random sample of a population used to estimate some parameter of the whole population. A very common estimator is actually the mean value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, when you already have the estimated quantity, it is time to answer the question. You need to tell the world your answer by **interpreting the data**.\n",

    "- Epidemic: The biggest topic of conversation this time of year has undoubtedly been the COVID-19 epidemic. The epidemic has changed our lives completely throughout the whole year, so you must have a lot of questions buried in your mind too. But for now, let's put aside all that natural science talk and look at the real society underneath the epidemic: who is suffering from medical overload; who has lost their lifeline to the economy because of silence; who has been forced to cut themselves off from their familiar lives and people because of isolation; or - although this is the world we can't see of the world - how many people have been saved by the sealing of the city by the dead? Or even, which side are you on, coexistence or zeroing *(both ideal or realistic are OK)*? Don't be in a hurry to make your choice, because your choice is often not a crude dichotomy. Use the data to defend your answer. **But please note that at no time should you abandon your empathy for people as individuals - they are more than data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Marital relationships: The marital relationship is probably one of the most important individual relationships in human society. There are many relationships that affect marriage, so there are many areas that can be investigated. Let's take the marriage and divorce rates as an example. Is there anything hidden behind these two seemingly common concepts of marriage and divorce rates? Are you really clear on their concepts? And are they a microcosm of social development? You can take data from one geographical area, from several geographical areas, or even from the whole country to explore. You could even pick one of the marriage and divorce rates to find your answer - perhaps, they are not as simple as you think.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The psychological status of children: You have probably heard of surveys on the psychological status of children. The psychological situation of children is also quite important for social development, so you could try to explore some of the issues in the existing situation. This is a complex topic, so you should pick out some very detailed factors: the family's financial situation, the parents' situation, or the geographical environment? In short, you may need to explore different lines of research to give your answers.\n",
